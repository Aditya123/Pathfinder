Pathfinder
==========

Name: Pathfinder 

Idea: An app that maps out local small businesses, customer shopping routes, small crowded bazaars/ farmers market kind of things. The maps are generated by pedometer and compass. In other words, distances are measured in steps and directions are detected by compass directions. Iâ€™ll draw a diagram of this before the hackathon starts. Idea still in progress so feel free to contribute.

a Model for our app is:
